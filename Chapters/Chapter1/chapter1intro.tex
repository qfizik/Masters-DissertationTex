This dissertation focuses on the study of quantum random walks and their implementation. Its structure and contributions are detailed in section \ref{sec:contrib}. Before that, however, the whole area of work is put in context along sections \ref{sec:historyQC} to \ref{sec:stateart}. The first one starts from the very beginning through a brief history of quantum computation, which aims at motivating a discussion on classical and quantum random walks in section \ref{sec:classicalandquantumwalks}. Finally, section \ref{sec:stateart} presents the the state of the art concerning the implementation of quantum walks as a background for the dissertationâ€™s contributions.
