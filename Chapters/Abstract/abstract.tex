Quantum computing is an emergent field that brings together quantum mechanics,
computer science and information theory, which promises improvements to
classical algorithms such as simulation of quantum systems, cryptography, data
base searching and many others. Quantum computing offers several different
models for quantum walks, which have complexity advantages over their classical
counterparts and many applications among which are element distinctness, searching
problems, matrix product verification and hitting times in graphs. The present
work offers a general theoretical overview, simulation and circuit
implementation of the coined, staggered and continuous-time quantum walk
models.
